FEATURE MAPPING EXPLANATION
===========================

The feature numbers in our malware detection model correspond to COLUMN POSITIONS 
in the original brazilian-malware.csv dataset.

ORIGINAL DATASET STRUCTURE:
===========================
The brazilian-malware.csv has 28 columns (0-27):

THE 5 KEY FEATURES FOR MALWARE DETECTION:
==========================================

Our simplified model uses these 5 most important features:

1. Feature '2' = Characteristics (Column 2)
   - PE file characteristic flags
   - Lower values tend to indicate malware
   - Importance: 10.4%

2. Feature '3' = DllCharacteristics (Column 3) 
   - DLL characteristic flags
   - Higher values tend to indicate malware
   - Importance: 12.1%

3. Feature '6' = FirstSeenDate (Column 6)
   - Timestamp when file was first detected
   - Lower values tend to indicate malware
   - Importance: 26.6% (MOST IMPORTANT!)

4. Feature '8' = ImageBase (Column 8)
   - Base memory address where PE is loaded
   - Higher values tend to indicate malware  
   - Importance: 5.4%

5. Feature '19' = SizeOfCode (Column 21 in original CSV!)
   - Size of the executable code section
   - Higher values tend to indicate malware
   - Importance: 5.0%

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT FEATURE '19':
==================================
Feature '19' is actually column 21 (SizeOfCode) from the original CSV!

This happened because:
1. Some columns were removed during preprocessing (like SHA1 hash)
2. Categorical columns (5, 12, 13, 17, 25) were one-hot encoded
3. The remaining numerical columns got renumbered
4. Column 21 (SizeOfCode) became feature '19' in the processed dataset

FEATURE ENGINEERING PROCESS:
============================
Original CSV (28 columns) → Data Cleaning → Categorical Encoding → Final Dataset (35 features)

- Removed: Non-predictive columns (SHA1 hash, etc.)
- Encoded: Categorical columns became multiple binary features
- Result: 35 total features with original column numbers as names

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
==================
- Full model (35 features): 99.24% accuracy
- Simplified model (5 features): 98.39% accuracy  
- Feature reduction: 85.7% fewer features
- Performance retention: 99.1%

This means you can achieve near-perfect malware detection using just:
- PE Characteristics flags
- DLL Characteristics flags  
- First detection timestamp
- Memory base address
- Code section size
